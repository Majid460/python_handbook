"""

You are working on a logic game made up of a series of puzzles. The first type of puzzle you settle on is "sub-Sudoku", a game where the player has to position the numbers 1..N on an NxN matrix.

Your job is to write a function that, given an NxN matrix, returns true if  every row and column contains the numbers 1..N

The UI for the game does not do any validation on the numbers the player enters, so the matrix can contain any signed integer.

         [3, 2, 1],
         [3, 1, 2]]            -> False (The first column is missing the value 2. It should contain the numbers 1,2 and 3.
                                         Similarly, the second column is missing the value 3.)
